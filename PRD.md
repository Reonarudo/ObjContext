# Product Requirements Document: ObjContext Framework Evolution

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the development goals and key milestones for the ObjContext framework, framed as a set of requirements. The purpose is to guide the evolution of the framework towards improved robustness, usability, and modern development practices. These goals are presented without specific timelines, allowing for flexible planning and resource allocation. The requirements listed herein are derived from an initial analysis of the framework and aim to address identified areas for enhancement and future growth.

## 2. Documentation Enhancements

- Requirement 2.1: Develop comprehensive developer guides. These guides shall cover framework architecture, initial setup procedures, and common usage patterns for implementing context-aware behaviors.
- Requirement 2.2: Produce a full API reference. This reference must detail all public classes, methods, protocols, and properties, including their parameters, return types, and purpose.
- Requirement 2.3: Create and maintain a collection of example projects. These projects should demonstrate practical applications of the framework, showcasing various use cases and best practices for developers.

## 3. Testing Infrastructure

- Requirement 3.1: Establish a comprehensive test suite. This suite must include unit tests verifying the functionality of individual framework components and integration tests validating end-to-end context adaptation scenarios.
- Requirement 3.2: Develop specific tests for critical framework operations. These include, but are not limited to, tests for configuration file loading and parsing, context activation and deactivation logic, and the correct application of adaptations to target behaviors.

## 4. Framework Robustness & Error Handling

- Requirement 4.1: Implement comprehensive error detection. This includes robust validation for configuration files (e.g., `.plist`, JSON), context definitions, and adaptation rules to identify malformed or inconsistent inputs.
- Requirement 4.2: Establish clear error logging mechanisms. The framework shall provide informative error messages, potentially with configurable verbosity levels (e.g., debug, info, warning, error) to aid in diagnostics.
- Requirement 4.3: Define and implement strategies for graceful error recovery. Where feasible, the framework should attempt to recover from non-critical errors or provide defined fallback behaviors when context sensing or adaptation processes encounter issues.

## 5. Architecture Review and Refinement

- Requirement 5.1: Conduct a thorough review of the current framework architecture. This review should identify areas for improvement in terms of modularity, separation of concerns, and clarity of component interactions.
- Requirement 5.2: Define and document clear interfaces between framework components. Ensure that internal APIs are well-defined and promote loose coupling.
- Requirement 5.3: Refine the architecture to enhance maintainability. Future architectural changes should aim to simplify understanding, debugging, and modification of the framework.
- Requirement 5.4: Ensure the architecture supports planned extensibility. The design should facilitate the addition of new context sources, adaptation mechanisms, and other future enhancements with minimal friction.

## 6. Configuration & Usability Enhancements

- Requirement 6.1: Develop tools to simplify configuration. This may include a Graphical User Interface (GUI) tool or a Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool designed to assist developers in creating, viewing, and managing context definitions and adaptation rules, thereby reducing reliance on manual `.plist` or JSON file editing.
- Requirement 6.2: Enhance programmatic configuration APIs. The framework's APIs for defining contexts and adaptations in code shall be reviewed and improved to offer a more fluent, intuitive, and type-safe developer experience.

## 7. Extensibility

- Requirement 7.1: Design and document a plugin API for custom context monitors. This API should allow third-party developers to easily create and integrate new context sources (`ContextMonitor`s) into the framework.
- Requirement 7.2: Define and document extension points for adaptation mechanisms. The framework should allow for the addition of new types of adaptation 'effectors,' enabling behaviors to be modified in ways beyond the initially supported set (e.g., beyond method swizzling if other techniques are relevant).

## 8. Swift Strategy & Interoperability

- Requirement 8.1: Enhance Objective-C headers for Swift compatibility. All public Objective-C headers must be audited and annotated with nullability (e.g., `nullable`, `nonnull`) and other relevant attributes (e.g., `NS_SWIFT_NAME`) to ensure optimal Swift bridging and a cleaner API when used from Swift.
- Requirement 8.2: Investigate and potentially develop a Swift wrapper API. This facade would expose ObjContext functionality using Swift-idiomatic patterns and types, making the framework more accessible and natural for Swift developers.
- Requirement 8.3: Formulate a long-term Swift strategy. This includes evaluating the feasibility and benefits of developing a native Swift version of the ObjContext framework or specific modules thereof.

## 9. Performance Optimization

- Requirement 9.1: Conduct performance profiling. Systematically analyze the framework to identify performance bottlenecks, particularly in context management, monitoring, and the application of adaptations.
- Requirement 9.2: Optimize critical code sections. Based on profiling results, refactor and optimize code sections that are critical to performance, especially those involving frequent operations or runtime modifications like method swizzling.

## 10. Debugging & Developer Tools

- Requirement 10.1: Implement enhanced logging for debugging. The framework must provide robust logging capabilities with configurable verbosity levels. Logs should help developers trace context changes, adaptation rule evaluations, and behavior modifications.
- Requirement 10.2: Develop context and adaptation inspection tools. Provide utilities or APIs that allow developers to inspect the current state of active contexts, the configuration of adaptations, and which adaptations are currently applied at runtime.
- Requirement 10.3: Introduce adaptation tracing features. Implement mechanisms to help developers understand why a specific adaptation was (or was not) triggered, and to trace the effects of applied adaptations on application behavior.
